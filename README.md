## Overview
After checking out a bunch of submissions on YouTube and Frontend Mentor, I gotta say, most were pretty disappointing. So, I decided to take on the challenge and create a solution that's almost pixel-perfect and works seamlessly on any screen sizeâ€”no compromises.

As I was working on it, I noticed some tiny hiccups in the design views. On desktop, the background SVG image looks a bit off at the lower edge, even though it fits perfectly everywhere else. Not my fault, though, blame it on design quirks. And then in the mobile view, the images aren't sitting right on both sides as they should. Just a heads up on those little quirks I stumbled upon.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Review the site's adaptive layout catering to various device screen sizes.
- Explore the hover states applied to interactive elements for a dynamic user experience.
- Examine the implementation of container queries, ensuring proportional positioning and sizing of foreground images relative to the background across different screen sizes.
- Investigate the utilization of advanced flexbox layout concepts to achieve balanced horizontal distribution of elements within the header and footer sections.
- Observe the effective application of the less commonly used flexbox align content rule, particularly in refining the menu layout within the footer.

## My process
- Aimed for maximum modularity in the solution, crafting distinct media queries for each component.
- Segmented the process into comprehensible parts, punctuated by clear commit messages for seamless navigation.
- Leveraged VS Code's bookmarking and split view functionalities to concurrently edit diverse sections of the code.
- Endeavored to refactor the CSS code, upholding a coherent and logical structure for improved comprehension.
- Initiated the project by addressing conspicuous elements, facilitating swift progress without delving too deep into the intricate details of the header section.
- used chat gpt to improve the style of my texts in this markdown file ðŸ˜‰



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS container queries
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript


### What I learned

I figured out how to organize my CSS code better so it's easier to follow. And while I was at it, I got the hang of using VS Code's cool tools for navigating through code and working with split views.

### Continued development

In the copyright section of the footer, I aimed to swap out the emoji for a PNG icon. The emoji wasn't playing nice with the text styling, refusing to match colors. Unfortunately, I haven't cracked the code yet on aligning them horizontally. My goal is to have the image cozy up to the copyright text, flowing to the right smoothly when the screen size gets narrower. Still figuring that part out.
